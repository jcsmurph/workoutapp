# workoutapp
This is a for fun project I am working on. 

The inspiration for this project came about when I realized I could not find a good mobile nor web application that would record my workouts in a way that made sense for me. Most of my workouts are recorded in an excel sheet, which seems to be the standard for both individuals and professional coaches. I wanted a web or mobile app that could act as a logbook for my workouts. Though I never plan to release this as a fully fledged product, I am excited for the trials and tribulations that come with developing a new application.

My goals for this project are:

  1. Learn the process of web application development from scratch
  2. Gain a better understanding of both backend and frontend development
  3. Build a complimentary mobile app for Andriod

The tech stack is planned as the following:

FrontEnd: TBD. Most likely React
BackEnd: Spring Boot
DataBase: MySQL
